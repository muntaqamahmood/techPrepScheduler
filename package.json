They can choose available times and our program will match another eligible user for a scheduled mock interview, the mock interview will have a shared code editor + compiler and the users will be able to communicate with each other with chatbox, and voice chat and webcam. These features will make the interview experience more realistic and will help people get better at technical rounds in tech interviews.",
